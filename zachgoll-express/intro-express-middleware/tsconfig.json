// Note: "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"] isn't required because "exclude" only changes which files are included as a result of the include setting.
// See: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#exclude

// Note: "rootDir": ["./src"] isn't required because the inferred value for rootDir is the longest common path of all non-declaration input files, which in this case is src/.
// See: https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#rootDir
