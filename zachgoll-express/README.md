## notes

- tsx is a typescript _runner_, which means it doesn't do type-checking.
  As such, `package.json` scripts are defined as:
  `"dev": "tsx src/index.ts",
"start": "tsc --noEmit && tsx src/index.ts",`
  where `start` will transpile and provide type-checking with no output file (`--noEmit`).

- The following article mentions that using nodemon with ts-node remains faster than using tsx: https://medium.com/modernnerd-code/tsx-vs-ts-node-and-nodemon-0ec60d21c5e1
  Because this current project is very small, this comparison can not be tested, and tsx seems to be overall easier to use, so we'll stick with it.

- The tsimp repo (https://github.com/tapjs/tsimp) explains the difference between current loaders and compilers available:

  > - swc is a TypeScript compiler implementation in Rust
  > - tsx is a zero-config TypeScript executer that aims to be a drop-in replacement for node, powered by esbuild.
  > - ts-node is probably the most established of these, with a huge feature set and support for every version of node and TypeScript you could possibly want.
